## Project Description
I chose my topic because I find the field of data analysis to be super interesting, but believe that the public is generally distrustful of private companies, especially social media companies, and how they collect and use our data. There have been many Orwellian dystopia metaphors attributed to modern life, with mention of a "surveillance state" and I wanted to find if there was a way forward that would help the field of data analysis to flourish with the trust of the public. 


## Questions & Hypotheses
What are the questions you would like to answer with your analysis? What did you feel were the answers to those questions before answering them with data?
My main hypothesis was that people are generally more scared about things that are unknown to them. Due to this, I thought that the sample of people that were more aware of how companies collect and use data would be less concerned about it. I will base my analysis on this hypothesis to find some kind of correlation in the data between some variable and their level of negative feelings towards how entities use and collect data.
